--- SECTION F — Feedback conflict check ---
You have user feedback above.
Ask yourself: given what this rule requires for a {scenario_type} outcome, does any
feedback instruction ask for attribute values that would push this prototype away from
that outcome?

  RISKY   → conflict = feedback makes the prototype less likely to trigger the rule
  GENUINE → conflict = feedback makes the prototype more likely to trigger the rule

Flag only clear directional conflicts. Ignore style or realism preferences.

IMPORTANT — still honor all feedback when generating the prototype. Just flag conflicts
so the user can be informed.

Required output format when feedback is present:
{{{{"{scenario_type}": {{{{"attr1": val, ...}}}}, "feedback_conflicts": [
  {{{{
    "feedback_instruction": "<conflicting instruction, quoted verbatim>",
    "conflicting_condition": "<rule condition affected, e.g. 'destination_amount > 500'>",
    "explanation": "<one sentence: why this makes the {scenario_type} validation fail>"
  }}}}
