# {feedback_section}
# --- END TASK CONTEXT ---

# --- SECTION A — Aggregate-first reasoning (follow these steps before generating) ---
# Think step by step:
# 1. Read the rule carefully. Identify the LOGICAL STRUCTURE.
#    - Is it a simple list of conditions (AND logic)?
#    - Is it a choice of conditions (OR logic)?
#    - For OR logic: You only need to satisfy ONE branch to make the rule FIRE (Risky).
#      You must FAIL ALL branches to make the rule NOT FIRE (Genuine).
#    - Decide which branch you will target for the scenario type.
# 2. For each aggregate condition, decide on concrete target values — how many transactions,
#    of what approximate sizes, are needed in the motif layer to satisfy or avoid the condition?
# 3. If the rule compares two aggregates from different time windows (e.g. recent 7d vs prior 30d),
#    remember that all windows are anchored at the date of the LAST transaction you generate.
#    Plan the final background transaction date first, then place filter-matching motif transactions
#    within the correct window relative to that anchor date. Do NOT mix up which transactions go
#    in which window — a "recent 7d" transaction must be within 7 days of the last transaction.
# 4. If any condition has a `group_by` attribute (e.g. group_by=beneficiary_id): the aggregate is
#    evaluated independently for each distinct group value. Generate transactions with at least
#    2–3 distinct values of the group_by attribute.
#    - For RISKY: concentrate enough motif transactions in ONE group so that group alone crosses
#      the threshold. Other groups should stay below the threshold for realism.
#    - For GENUINE: ensure NO single group accumulates enough to cross the threshold — spread
#      motif transactions across multiple groups.
# 5. If any condition uses `shared_distinct_count` (the raw_expression contains "shared_distinct_count"
#    or mentions "share email/phone" or similar):
#    - For RISKY: generate ≥2 distinct customer_ids in the target recipient group with the SAME value
#      for at least one of the link attributes (e.g. user_A and user_B both have email="shared@x.com").
#      Other recipient groups should have senders with unique PII — no unintended sharing.
#    - For GENUINE: ensure every customer_id in EVERY recipient group has a UNIQUE value for ALL link
#      attributes — no two senders share email, phone, or any other link attribute.
#    - Always include the link attribute fields (e.g. email, phone) in every transaction's attributes.
# 6. What does a realistic background for this account type look like?
# The rule fires on AGGREGATES — individual transactions should reflect real account history,
# not a direct demonstration of the rule.

# --- SECTION B — Background + Motif composition ---
# Structure the sequence as two interleaved layers:
# - BACKGROUND: Normal account activity unrelated to the rule's filter. Use different
#   destinations, amounts, and patterns. Include enough background transactions to make
#   the account history look real — the right number depends on the rule, not a fixed ratio.
# - MOTIF: The rule-relevant subset. Let the rule's own thresholds determine how many motif
#   transactions are needed. If the rule requires counting 25 transactions to a single
#   recipient, generate at least 25 such transactions — do not cap motif count artificially.
#   For RISKY: sized and placed to push the aggregate past the threshold.
#   For GENUINE: sized to stay just below the threshold, but not obviously so.
# Interleave motif transactions across the timeline. Do NOT append them all at the end.

# --- SECTION C — Customer archetype ---
# If user intent is provided, infer a consistent customer profile (e.g. migrant worker,
# small business owner, student, retail trader). Hold this profile across the full sequence:
# transaction sizes, frequency, destinations, and timing should all be consistent with
# the account type. If no intent is provided, infer a plausible profile from the rule's
# attributes and generate accordingly.

# --- SECTION D — Value variance ---
# Do not cluster amounts near the threshold. Background amounts should vary freely.
# Motif amounts should vary naturally (some higher, some lower) — the aggregate target
# must be met in total, but individual values should look organic, not robotic.
# Exception: if the intent explicitly implies structuring, clustering is acceptable.

# --- SECTION E — Temporal realism ---
# Order transactions by date with realistic spacing:
# - Most activity on weekdays
# - Occasional same-day pairs (normal for active accounts)
# - Include 1-2 quiet periods of 3-7 days with no transactions
# - The timeline must be long enough to cover all of the rule's time windows. If the rule
#   has a single window (e.g. 30 days), span at least that many days. If it has multiple
#   non-overlapping windows (e.g. a recent period + a prior period), span their combined
#   length and place motif transactions in the correct window for each.
# - Background transactions can extend freely across the full timeline.
# - The LAST transaction in the sequence (most recent date) MUST be a background transaction.
#   IMPORTANT — window anchoring: all time windows are measured backwards from the date of
#   that final background transaction (latest_date). If the rule has a "recent 7d" window,
#   your filter-matching motif transactions for that window must be dated within 7 days BEFORE
#   the final background transaction — not 7 days before today or some other reference point.
#   Decide the final background transaction date FIRST, then work backwards to place motif
#   transactions in the correct windows relative to that date.

# --- Hard requirements ---
# - Generate as many transactions as the rule requires. Let the rule's thresholds determine
#   the minimum — if a condition needs a count of 25 to a single recipient, you need at least
#   25 such transactions. Add enough background beyond that to make the account look realistic.
# - For RISKY: must make at least one OR-branch true (choose one branch and satisfy it fully).
# - For GENUINE: must make every OR-branch false (ensure each branch fails).
# - Use realistic dates in YYYY-MM-DD format for the initiated_at field.
# - IMPORTANT — Attribute keys: use ONLY the canonical attribute names listed in the schema above as JSON keys.
#   Do NOT use aliases (e.g. use "source_amount" not "amount", "destination_country_code" not "country" or "destination_country").
#   Only populate the relevant attributes ({attributes}) plus initiated_at.
# - IMPORTANT — Country values: use the EXACT same string as listed under HIGH-RISK COUNTRIES above
#   (e.g. if high_risk_countries = ["Iran"], set destination_country_code to "Iran" — NOT "IR" or "IRN").
#   The validation engine matches both attribute keys and country values by exact string comparison.

--- END TASK CONTEXT ---

--- SECTION A — Planning Steps (follow internally before generating) ---

STEP A1 — Parse all conditions:
List each condition: aggregate type (sum/count/average/distinct_count/ratio/difference), window, filters, threshold, group_by.

STEP A2 — Handle OR condition groups:
If rule has multiple condition groups connected by OR:
  - RISKY: pick the EASIEST group to satisfy (fewest transactions/lowest totals). 
    Only need to satisfy ALL conditions within ONE group.
    
    **To compare group difficulty**: Calculate minimum transactions and totals for each group, pick the lower one.
    
  - GENUINE: must FAIL every group. Stay below threshold in ALL groups.
If only one group (all AND): must satisfy/avoid every condition.

STEP A3 — Calculate exact targets:
For each condition in target group:
  - COUNT > N: need exactly N+1 or more matching transactions
  - SUM > X: need total strictly greater than X
  - AVERAGE > X: need average = sum/count > X
    * Set count first, then ensure sum > X × count
    * Add 5% safety margin: aim for average = threshold × 1.05
  - DISTINCT_COUNT > N: need N+1 distinct values
  - RATIO recent/prior > T: 
    * Ensure prior > 0 (denominator never zero)
    * For RISKY: set recent ≥ floor(T × prior) + 1
    * For GENUINE: keep recent < T × prior
  - DIFFERENCE A - B > N:
    * Ensure A > B + N
    * For RISKY: make A sufficiently larger than B

STEP A4 — Handle group_by logic:
If condition has group_by (e.g., group_by=beneficiary_id):
  - Aggregate evaluated independently per distinct group value
  - RISKY: pick ONE target group value (e.g., beneficiary_id="A"). 
    ALL motif transactions go to this SAME value.
  - GENUINE: spread transactions across 3+ group values so NO single group crosses threshold.

STEP A5 — Handle "new entity" conditions:
If condition checks "new recipient", "new country", "first transaction to X":
  - Implemented as days_since_first with group_by
  - "New" means entity appears EXACTLY ONCE in the sequence
  
  CRITICAL — Multiple "new" requirements:
  If rule requires BOTH "new recipient" AND "new country":
  - Each motif transaction needs a UNIQUE beneficiary_id AND a UNIQUE country
  - Transaction 1: recipient_A, country_X
  - Transaction 2: recipient_B, country_Y (different recipient AND country)
  - Transaction 3: recipient_C, country_Z (different recipient AND country)
  
  DO NOT repeat the same beneficiary_id or country across motif transactions.

STEP A6 — Handle multi-filter conditions:
If condition has multiple filters (e.g., sender_age >= 60 AND new_recipient AND new_country):
  - EVERY motif transaction must satisfy ALL filters simultaneously
  - A transaction failing ANY filter won't count toward the aggregate
  
  For each planned motif transaction, verify:
  * sender_age >= 60 → birthdate at least 60 years before transaction date
  * new_recipient → beneficiary_id appears only once in entire sequence
  * new_country → destination_country_code appears only once in entire sequence
  * nationality != country → citizenship_code, origin_country_code, destination_country_code all different

STEP A7 — Set sender attributes correctly:
For age-based filters:
  - Set birthdate to be at least 60 years before transaction dates
  - Example: transactions in 2024-01 → birthdate ≤ 1964-01
  - CRITICAL: ALL transactions must have SAME birthdate, citizenship_code, origin_country_code (same sender)

STEP A8 — Handle derived/difference computed attributes:
If condition uses DIFFERENCE of two distinct_count CAs (e.g., distinct_senders - distinct_addresses > 4):
  - This means multiple senders are SHARING the same attribute value
  - For RISKY: 
    * Need distinct_senders > distinct_attribute + threshold
    * Generate transactions from multiple different customer_ids
    * Make some senders share the same address/email/phone/device_id
    * Example: distinct_senders - distinct_addresses > 4
      → Need 10 senders using 5 addresses → 10 - 5 = 5 > 4 ✓
  - For GENUINE:
    * Make each sender have unique attribute values (no sharing)

STEP A9 — Plan time windows:
  - LAST transaction in sequence = anchor date
  - All windows measured backwards from this anchor
  - Place motif transactions within correct window relative to anchor
  - For "new entity" checks: typically windowless (checks ALL history)

STEP A10 — Plan background:
  - Background must NOT satisfy any filter conditions
  - Use different recipients, countries, or failing filter values
  - Never interfere with motif hard targets from Step A3

--- SECTION B — Self-verification (MANDATORY before output) ---
Verify each check:

CHECK 1 — COUNT/SUM/AVERAGE TARGETS:
  Does motif count meet threshold? Does sum exceed threshold?
  For average: sum/count > threshold?

CHECK 2 — TIME WINDOW:
  Are all motif transactions within the correct window relative to last transaction date?

CHECK 3 — MULTI-FILTER COMPLETENESS:
  For each motif transaction: does it satisfy EVERY filter condition?
  If ANY filter fails, transaction won't count.

CHECK 4 — NEW ENTITY UNIQUENESS:
  For "new recipient": does each beneficiary_id appear EXACTLY ONCE?
  For "new country": does each country appear EXACTLY ONCE?
  Count occurrences — no duplicates allowed.

CHECK 5 — SENDER ATTRIBUTE CONSISTENCY:
  Is birthdate the same on ALL transactions?
  Is citizenship_code the same on ALL transactions?
  Is origin_country_code the same on ALL transactions?

CHECK 6 — GROUP ISOLATION:
  If group_by set: does only target group cross threshold (RISKY) or none (GENUINE)?

CHECK 7 — DERIVED CA CORRECTNESS:
  For difference of distinct_count: 
  - distinct_senders > distinct_attribute + threshold?
  - Multiple senders share same attribute value?

If ANY check fails, fix before outputting.

--- Hard requirements ---
- Use ONLY canonical attribute names from schema as JSON keys
- Use EXACT high-risk country strings (e.g., "Iran" not "IR")
- Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- "last month" = 30 days, "last 6 months" = 180 days
- Background must FAIL filter conditions (different status/country/etc.)
