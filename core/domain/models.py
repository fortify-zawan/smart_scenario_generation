class ComputedAttr:
    """A named intermediate value computed from a transaction sequence before condition evaluation.

    Defined at the Rule level so multiple conditions can reference it by name.
    The engine computes all ComputedAttrs once (in order) before evaluating any condition.

    All CAs inject their computed value into t.attributes[name] so later CAs can
    reference them in filters. Comparisons always live on conditions or filters — never
    baked into the CA itself.

    Three output modes:

      Scalar (group_by=None, derived_from=None):
        aggregation(attribute)[window] over filtered transactions → one value.
        Stored in aggregates[name] and injected into every t.attributes[name].
        Example: avg(send_amount)[30d] where country=Kenya → 342.5

      Group (group_by set):
        aggregation(attribute) computed per distinct group value in the windowed subset.
        The raw per-group aggregate is injected into each t.attributes[name].
        Later CA filters compare directly: e.g. {attribute: is_new_recipient, op: ==, value: 1}.
        Example: count(transaction_id) group_by=recipient_id
          → t.attributes["is_new_recipient"] = 1 for first-time recipients, 2 for second, etc.

      Derived (derived_from set, aggregation="ratio" or "difference"):
        Combines two previously computed scalar CAs using arithmetic.
        aggregation="ratio"      → derived_from[0] / derived_from[1]
        aggregation="difference" → derived_from[0] - derived_from[1]
        attribute/window/filters/group_by are ignored.
        Stored in aggregates[name] and injected into all t.attributes[name].

    CAs are computed in declaration order; later CAs can reference earlier CA names in
    their filters or derived_from (since earlier CAs have already injected their values).
